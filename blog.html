        <h2>Goals of Kung Fu and its moral codes</h2>
        <p id="goals">
        <img src="images/blog1.JPG" width="350px" height="300px" alt="kung fu" class="float-left">
        The most important goal of learning Kung Fu is self-defense, in ancient time before firearms were invented, Mastering Kung Fu was considered a matter of life and death for many people.
        Today, that goal has shifted toward defending oneself against an enemy or to protect dear ones in a battle. But some kung Fu masters and their students believe that the end goal of practicing kung Fu was not for fighting but for enhancing their health, in other words some Kung Fu masters believe that the health-promoting function of kung Fu is essential but without it is self-defense function it cannot be considered as Kung Fu but as a kind of health promoting exercises.
        Enhancing one’s health is another important function of learning Kung Fu, when a person practices Kung Fu very well it will help him/her to become mentally and physically fit.
        The other important goal of learning kung Fu is character development, this is an important factor that Kung Fu masters should instill into their students.
        Kung Fu requires students to follow a certain moral code. There are three qualities that students naturally acquire during their long journey of learning Kung Fu, these three qualities are- patience, insight, and calmness, for you need patience to develop your Kung Fu techniques, insight to understand how Kung Fu principles work, and calmness to anticipate your opponent’s movements and respond in the most appropriate and efficient manner.
